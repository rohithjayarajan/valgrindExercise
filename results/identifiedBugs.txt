The two bugs identified in the program are:

    1. Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s) at 0x401DC7: main (main.cpp:9). bool terminator is uninitialized
    2. Memory leak at AnalogSensor::Read() (AnalogSensor.cpp:16). The vector memory allocator for "readings" was not deleted after use.

These two bugs have been fixed.
